you may want to not use stdlib because you develop for embedded systems.

(no rtti, no exceptions are requirements)
thus you don't use the stdlib.

strings
=======

std::string in 98

class string
{

  char* data;      // the string
  size_t size;     //Length
  size_t capacity; //LEN


}


------------------------------

what is copy constructor?

copy constructors instantiate new instances by copying existing ones:


class example
{
 public:
    example();      // default constructor
    example(const example&) //copy constructor
    {
        // this is the copy constructor
    }
}


how to call

int main(void)
{
    example x1; //normal ctor
    example x2 = x1; // copy ctor, creating new object from an existing obj
    example x3(x2); // copy ctor, same

    foo(x1); // calls the copy ctor to copy the argument for foo

}

also when passing class object by value, or when returning object by value.


then there'll be constructors

public:
   string(const string& s) //copy constructor
      : data(s.clone()) // new + memmove (may be malloc, memcpy)
      {}
    // ... //takes array of char
    string(const char* s); //new + memmove

both constructors will allocate dynamic memory and move symbols there


--------

std::map<string, int> m;

m.insert(
   std::pair<string, int> ("Hello!", 1)
   );

   this works slowly because
   * first constructor of string is called (new, memmove)
   * then the constructor of the pair, which will initiate copy constructor of string (new, memmove again)
   * then the string will be copied to the pair. (new, memmove)
   * then the temporary object for pair and string will be freed.
   // (new + memmove) * 2 + delete
   // new + memmove + delete


COW

  waste of time happens mostly because of temporary objects.
  it may be that several pointers point to one object of string.
  then it should have reference count.


  class string_impl
  {
    char* data;
    size_t size;
    size_t capacity;
    size_t use_count;
  }


  copy constructor

  class string
  {
    string_impl* impl;
  public:
    string(const string& s)
      : impl(s.impl)
      {
        ++ impl->use_count;
      }

   };


   when you have a function, which modifies the string, then
   you check if you are the only one who owns the string
   if yes, you modify it
   otherwise you copy it and then only modify.


   class string
   {
      string_impl* impl;
      public:
      char& operator[](size_t)
      {
        if (impl->use_count > 1)
           *this = clone();
      }
      return impl->data[i];

   }


   destructor decreases reference count
   if you are the only owner of the dynamic memory it may be freed.

   class string
   {
      string_impl* impl;
    public:
      ~string()
        {
         -- impl->use_count;
         if (!impl->use_count
         {
            delete impl;
         }
        }

   }


   now again, what if we do m.insert

   std::map<string, int> m;

   m.insert(
      std::pair<string, int>("Hello, 1)
       );

   * constructor from the character array - same shit (new, memmove)
   * then copy constructor will be called when creating a pair.
   it has no new or memmove.
   * when pair will be inserted into the map, then again copy constructor of the string is called, which does not call new or memmove.
   therefore no destructor of temporary object will call delete.

   COW is more than twice as fast as c++98 string.

  Qt uses COW almost in every base class.
  Pascal uses COW.

  ---------

  then

  * hyper-threading in pentium 4 arrives
  * two core amd64  arrives
  * then two core x86_64 arrives

 now our reference counter has problems
 because it is shared
 in case we have two objects on different cores

 assume two string objects will try to decrease reference count simultaneously.
 whether we get a memory leak or a program crash.

 now, how to fix this.

COW MT fix

class string_impl
{

  char* data;
  size_t size;
  size_t capacity;
  atomic<size_t> use_count; // the fix
}


back then there was no atomic.h which implements atomic operations.


now constructor also has atomic structure

class string
{
  string_impl* impl;
public:
  string(const string& s) //constructor
    : impl(s.impl)
    {
       ++ impl-> use_count; //atomic
    }
  char& operator[](size_t i)
  {
    if impl->use_count > 1) //atomic
    {
       string cloned = clone(); //new + memmove + atomic
       swap (*this, cloned);
       //atomic in  ~string for cloned; delete in ~string if other thread released the string 
    }

  }
}


MT troubles:
 imagine one thread copies the string.
 other thread decides to delete the string, while other still copying it.


 why atomic operations are slowly

 on x86 non atomic INC - 1 tick.

 atomic INC ~5-20+ ticks, if the core 'owns' the atomic.
 if other core 'owns' then around 40 ticks.
